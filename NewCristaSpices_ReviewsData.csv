I love the packaging also - allows you to use it in smaller quantities (shaker side) and in bulk (spoon side). This has a dark red color and tastes amazing on top of fries and grilled paneer. It is not extremely spicy and can be used by everyone. The mix of mild smoky spiciness with sweetness at the end is just yum. Thumbs up.
Black Salt Powder,ground spices,1.0,Don't buy,"I recently purchased himalayan salt. Upon attempting to dissolve the salt in water, I noticed that it didn't dissolve completely. Even after stirring vigorously, there were still visible particles and a few stubborn pieces of sand left behind in the cup. This was quite disappointing, as I expected a high-quality product that would dissolve seamlessly.Moreover, the presence of sand particles raises concerns about the purityand quality of the salt. It's unsettling to find such impurities in a productthat is supposed to be natural and pristine.In conclusion, I cannot recommend this Himalayan salt from Amazon based onmy experience. The lack of solubility and the presence of sand particles aresignificant drawbacks that detract from its value and usability."
